# AirBnB Clone

ALX clone of the famous [Air BnB](https://www.airbnb.com/)

## Description

This project helps to understand and use concepts in the ALX higher level programming track (Python). During this project, we will be building a clone of of the AirBnB property booking system.

## The Command Interpreter

This will be like a sandbox for testing our project. We may use the sandbox to:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an objec- Destroy an object

### How to use the Interpreter: interactive mode

```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

### How to use the Interpreter: non-interactive mode

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```
